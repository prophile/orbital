Orbital
=======

Orbital is an [Escape Velocity][ev]-style to be made for One Game A Month, May
2014.  It is single-player, 2D, and ships without steak knives.

The basic mechanics broadly follow the tropes of a science fiction open-world
RPG: you have a *ship*, which can be flown around in -- and *jumped* between --
*star systems*. There are *stellar objects* including *planets*, *moons* and
*space stations* in *systems*, some of which can be *landed* on. There are also
*AI ships*, some which may or may not be *hostile*. In space, the player can
*fight* other ships. On stellar objects, the player has the option of *buying
new ships* at the *shipyard*, *trading* resources known as *junks*, or buying
*outfits* at the *outfitter* to upgrade their ship with new *weapons*, new
capabilities, or increased performance.
